# A limitation with wexpect is that we use expect("string") to determine
# when we should stop reading from the console and carry on with the script.
# Usually, the > character is expected as this is what will appear in the console
# when it's finished, however if a command outputs a > somewhere, for example the
# dir command will list directories with a <DIR>, the output will be cut off.

# Therefore, whenever we cd, we can use the current working directory as a basis for the 
# prompt, like: C:\Users\AUS> as we know this line is displayed when requesting the next 
# input (i.e. the command has finished). However, there is an extremely rare case where a 
# program may output something identical to this, so there should be some care in how you
# define your expect prompts.
